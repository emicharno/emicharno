- 👋 Hi, I’m Emilia!
- 🌱 I’m currently a Master in City Planning student at MIT studying community-wealth building, energy microgrids, and rights of nature applications.
- 💞️ I’d love to collabote on projects that enhance human interactions with the natural world and build power for workers and communities in the energy transition. 
- 📫 You can reach me at ercharno@mit.edu. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: In my free time, you can find me outside, caring for urban street trees, or exploring local trails.
